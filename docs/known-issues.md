# Known Issues

*8/6/19*

*Sitecore.HabitatHome.Foundation.Accounts.Models.AccountCollectionModel*.config has been changed to *Sitecore.Demo.Foundation.Accounts.Models.AccountCollectionModel*.config. This fixes an issue with Marketing Automation. After this change, the old file may still be present in [web root path]\App_Data\xConnectModels and will need to be deleted.
